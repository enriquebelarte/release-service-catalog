# set-advisory-severity

Tekton task to set the severity level in the releaseNotes key of the data.json. It will use an InternalRequest to query
OSIDB for each CVE present. If the type is not RHSA, no action will be performed. This check is only performed for
images and not for generic artifact types like binaries or disk images.

## Changes in 1.0.4
* Undo changes introduced in 1.0.2
  * Early failure prevents pasting of internal pipelineRun or taskRun

## Changes in 1.0.3
* Skip severity setting for generic artifact types

## Changes in 1.0.2
* Improve logging of `internal-request`
  * Previously we would just swallow the output and if it failed for any reason, the log wouldn't have anything useful

## Changes in 1.0.1
* Update the requestTimeout default value to 45 mins

## Changes in 1.0.0
* This task now supports Trusted artifacts

## Changes in 0.1.3
* Update the requestTimeout default value to 30 mins

## Changes in 0.1.2
* Update the task to fail if the type is RHSA and no CVEs are provided

## Changes in 0.1.1
* If a non RHSA type is provided, remove the severity key in case the user provided it
